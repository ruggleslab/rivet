    "# RIVET (Ribosomal Investigation and Visualization to Evaluate Translation)\n",
    "\n",
    "RIVET is a simple to use R-shiny based graphical user interface to automate the statistical analysis of RNA sequencing data and microarray data generated by either polysome profiling or ribosome footprinting.  RIVET requires a tab-delimited or comma-delimited text file of counts data (commonly generated in many RNA seq computational pipelines) or background corrected and normalized microarray data.  The main goal of RIVET is to make data analysis of data generated by genome-wide translatome experiments accessible to bench scientists.\n",
